title: Working on website and server load balancing
---

I've been making a few tweaks to the website. In the long run, I'm still puzzling about a proper vision for a Jekyll theme, but for now, to 'get things done' (an adage in the software industry), I've just added some links to the pages I want to the navigation, and bumped the site avatar and name down since the width of the jekyll-now theme container is small enough that the number of links caused line wrapping.

I found myself getting caught up in what I would want in the long run, and how much work I could sink into the website without it reaching half of what I want it to be. However, after obssessing over it last night, I've decided it's best not to try to force things into a mold before they are willing to yield. (Yes, I'm talking about my website. ðŸ˜‹) It would be better to wait until I naturally think of a simple idea that would be easy to implement, and still pleasing.

For now, I'm working on load balancing the servers Holberton has provided us, which I'm also planning to use to host my projects and domain for this website. One of the things Holberton prides itself upon is teaching system administration and devops as part of their vision of what a full-stack engineer's knowledge should encompass. I often share this sentiment when we encounter some of the sysadmin projects in our curriculum. (For sure, I doubt CS students in a traditional university learn how to manage their own infrastructure.) 

Right now, I'm roughly following this DigitalOcean [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-haproxy-as-a-layer-4-load-balancer-for-wordpress-application-servers-on-ubuntu-14-04) as a guide, and it involves using GlusterFS to mount a volume and sync filedata. I find that DigitalOcean guides are generally suited to my level of knowledge and easy to follow, but also take some time to explain the process and relevant concepts.
