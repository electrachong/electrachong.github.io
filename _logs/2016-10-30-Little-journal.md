title: Little journal after starting work
---

I badly want to work on this website, as I need it to serve as a creative / reflective outlet for me, but for now, I have some other priorities on the top burner. I started work a few weeks ago--four, if I count correctly. Life keeps swinging by, and time has passed very quickly, so it's hard to keep things updated here and elsewhere.

Work has been good, overall. I don't want to say too much about my company, for professional image reasons, but I like the team I'm working with and the technological problems are interesting. It's made me feel very green around the ears. I had the privilege of recently witnessing a new batch of Holberton students tackle a hackathon with three weeks of knowledge. It made me realize how far I've come since starting Holberton myself, while grasping how much my team mates know about programming compared to myself makes me realize how much farther I still have to go.

I still have so much more to learn. To summarize my goals for the moment, in a year's time, I hope to have reached the level of knowledge of the most junior members on my team besides myself and my cohort of new hires. My goal is to wield JavaScript as one wields a sharp knife to cut butter (instead of an ineffectual butter knife to cut anything else). üòÅ After that, I can focus on design problems and developing a level of expertise, since I have access to people who think about these problems and the opportunity to tackle them myself.

I had a moment during that first week of work where I sat at my desk and felt this sense of novelty come over me: just nine months ago, I thought that I would spend at least a couple years working at my college in the IT department, building up my knowledge slowly and seeing where I'd like to go after that. Then Holberton came around, and now all of a sudden, here I am, working as a software engineer on the 25th floor of a fancy commercial building facing the bay-- but more importantly, for a legitimate company. I wouldn't have been able to anticipate it, only a few months prior. It definitely doesn't feel like it's been 9 months, anyway. A) I'm incredibly lucky, and B) life doesn't wait for you.

Other than that, my company has a sports benefits program and I'm starting skating (ice skating) lessons starting tomorrow. I'm pretty excited about this. Yeona Kim's grace on the ice somewhat inspires me to try to live my life with similar grace--corny as it sounds--so I think it will lend my life a nice balance to try to attain some physical discipline on one side and focus on my mental acuity (programming mojo) on the other. JS is my bae right now, and I'm not too interested in picking up new attachments besides maintaining what's important right now: my family, a few friends, and a little of my non-programming related hobbies.

As a side note, the content of these development logs tend to be somewhat journal-like in nature, so I think that when I develop this site, I might include them in my blog section and just set a filter by tag to pull some more work-related log-like entries into this section. My initial inclination was to divorce more professional content (tutorials, summaries of projects) from reflective pieces, and enforce a clean separation of professional and personal identities, but it seems I have a habit of being reflective and writing lengthy ruminations by nature, which makes it hard to enforce such a clean separation. And maybe it's OK not to compartmentalize so much.

----------
More thoughts: I've grown fond of the unique personalities on my team.  
It's nice to work closely with important people in the team/company, and have access to their knowledge and experience.
I'd like to write some lists of things I learned that I didn't already know from Holberton, and list some resources I've used as a beginner to brush up on Node.  
** I also appreciate that despite not being a tech giant, my company offers decent benefits and a place to work (sports, nice snacks, a view, a unique culture, and travel). I don't know that I would find the same culture any where else.  
** There are some more things to list about how I adjusted to work and getting a handle on my feelings about it, perhaps as a private entry or in conversation with friends.
