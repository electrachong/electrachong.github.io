title: Mulling on things I'd like to do + weaknesses

## Weaknesses: Multi-tasking 
Recently, during an interview I had with the research lead at Scality, I was asked my greatest weakness. This is a very typical interview question, but I hadn't prepared for it and was quick to admit it. (The interview I had at Scality was my first tech interview, arranged through connections at Holberton, and my interview preparation was limited to the day I spent before writing up answers to common but selected questions provided by one of the hbtn founders). Put on the spot, I said the first thing I could think of, which was related to an answer I had prepared for another question, about how I interact with team mates.[1] I didn't feel like it was a fair answer because it was the first thing I thought of, and didn't seem like a true or meaningful weakness.

Since then, I've been thinking about it sporadically. I haven't decided yet what is my _greatest_ weakness, but one of them is probably my issue leaving things half-finished and splitting my attention.

Case in point: it's been a while since my last log. When I set it up, I kind of hoped I could write logs regularly-- if not every day, maybe every other day or few days, or once a week at least. Just something quick, to note what I was working on and my progress.[2] There's a reason why it took me a while to set up a personal website in the first place, though. I think I have a tendency to want to devote my energies to whatever I'm working on at the moment. Ostensibly, what I'm focused on at the moment is keeping up with Holberton assignments, and it's hard for me to carve out times for other goals.

Right now, I'm feeling quite a bit behind in developing the API for the team Airbnb clone project, and I've spent most of my time on that rather than working on the other projects (sorry, load-balancing, Mysql master-slave set-up, Chef, binary trees, N-trees) and writing up reflections on my personal website. Part of it is out of a feeling of obligation to others, my team mates, when working on group projects.

 I don't think it's atypical to have a hard time with multitasking. I think it's a rather universal difficulty. But it does run counter a bit to the "get sh*t done" motto of the software industry/start-ups in particular. And I think for myself in particular, because I am detail-oriented, sometimes inefficient, and sometimes perfectionistic, whatever I'm work on tends to expand and take up all of my time, so I never get to other goals. This was actually something I struggled with in college (as well as high school).
 
 To return to the example at hand, the logs are supposed to be low-cost in time and effort if necessary. That is, they can be minimal to fulfill their base purpose of logging what I'm working on and my progress. But because I'm detail-oriented, I naturally feel the impulse to compose verbose reflections, and it becomes a costlier endeavor that I automatically avoid to focus on what I'm feeling behind on.[3]
 
## Things I want to do
 Anyway, there's a lot that I want to do. I was reading a book about preparing for whiteboarding algorithms, and it made me think of all the things I would need to do to be properly prepared for interviews.
 - I need to spend time practicing algorithms, which which I'm not familiar with exception of the low-level problems and data structures we've been introduced to in the low-level track.
 - I need to spend some time to systemetically prepare for interviews: knowing in-detail what I could say about my technical projects, how I introduce myself.
 - I also need to be able to research the companies I would interview for, so I can ask specific questions about their technology problems, as well as know the backgrounds of people I might speak to.
 - I actually want to spend some time learning about my interests: graphics progrmaming, Lua, the pros/cons of langauges I'm interested in, so I can speak about them.
 - Of course, I want to finish editing the Jekyll theme for this website, and work on my other projects (pokelog, Josei Beat, twitter clone...)
 
 As discussed above, I struggle with wanting to do lots of things and focusing on what has my imperative at the moment. Hopefully I can think of some strategies to address this and write about it for my next log.
 
 -------------------
 [1] I said that people tend to describe as empathetic, but sometimes this means I lean towards accomodating my team mates over my own opinions or interests, and I require trust to be comfortable speaking up when I disagree with others. (Doesn't mean I won't speak up if I find it important enough, but I will feel discomfort over it, which is a significant hurdle.)
 
 [2] Maybe I should commit to one log at the same time I submit captain's log, which is enforced on the Holberton intranet every Sunday. If we don't fill out a captain's log, we don't have access to our projects.
 
 [3] Maybe this is sometimes the cost of having an analytical tendency, like the issue with ruminating over small and large things.
