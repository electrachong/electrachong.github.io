title: Greetings!

I've been noodling on starting a personal website for a while, to display my programming projects, log progress, maintain a resume and also to keep a personal blog.

Actually, I've wanted to have a personal website/blog for years, but I always felt a compulsion to code it from scratch-- as if I wouldn't feel total ownership if I used a content management system like Wordpress. Since starting my adventures as a programmer, I've come to read about Jekyll here and there, and to become intrigued by it. I thought it would be a nice, lightweight compromise. 

It was easy to start from forking Barry Clark's [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) github repository. So far I've only modified the logo and some of the text. I have a lot on my agenda:

* Creating a custom Jekyll theme
* Creating separate pages: devlog (hopefully where this would be featured as the first post), about, personal blog, resume, and linking to projects
* Working to improve my projects:
  * [pokelog](https://github.com/electrachong/pokelog) (formerly pokediary) needs work before publishing a working version to Docker Hub
  * improve [twitter-clone](http://jellycube.space/twitter-clone/index.php) front-end
  * re-adding a wordpress blog [josei beat](http://jellycube.space/josei-beat/)
  * In addition, I'd like to put up a guide to http requests I'm working on, and see if I might put up an improved version of a commando project I built with other Holberton students.
* Creating the resume to host on my website

I'm hoping to get the bulk of this done within this week/weekend, as I'd like to attend the [internapalooza](http://internapalooza.com) on July 11, and would like to have some professional presence and a web resume up by then!
