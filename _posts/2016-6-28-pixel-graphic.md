 title: My first pixel graphic in a decade
---
 
I didn't have Illustrator on the school computers I was using to make this website today, so I opted instead to make a hasty pixel graphic for the website logo.
 
It's been a while since I've made a pixel graphic.. more like a decade! In my heydey as a 10-year-old playing Neopets, I used to enjoy making pixels for fun, was even a part of a pixeling/scribbling<sup>[1](#---)</sup> guild, and had quite a good opinion of my pixeling ability.
 
I imagine I was more skilled back then, but as an amateur my method nonetheless remains fundamentally the same. (Meaning, I resort to overlaying my canvas on a reference photo so I can trace it if needed. ðŸ˜™)
 
Here is the reference image I used this time:

I like to give credit where possible, so I'd like to share that it came from [this page](https://beginningmiddleandtheedge.com/2012/09/19/jelly-on-the-plate-wibble-wobble-jelly-on-the-plate/), but I'm not confident the author is the original owner of this photo, either.
 
I used a neat little online pixel sprite editor, called [Piskel](http://www.piskelapp.com/), that a classmate showed me. (Thanks Steven!)

In this case, I didn't want to trace it painstakingly pixel-by-pixel, so I approximated the areas of color and their shades hazaphardly, hoping they would come together with some fiddling. For now, I think it's passable, if rudimentary.

[1] Another art-style for graphics that was accessible for 10-year-olds on Neopets, predicated on imitating a casual, hand-drawn quality with a scribbled line-style.
